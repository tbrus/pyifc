## The directory containing stub files (*.pyi)

**Stub file** is a file used to determine types of standard library
and third-party library functions, classes and other definitions.
The most known collection providing these utilities is
[typeshed](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
*.pyi files from this directory contain information about types that
have not been specified in typeshed collection yet.

Before creating your own stub file for one package make sure that
package's types are not already specified in
[typeshed](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
