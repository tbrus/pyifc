# pyifc: Utilities for .ifc files

[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/tbrus/pyifc)](https://github.com/tbrus/pyifc)

## What is it?

**pyifc** is a Python package that provides utilities for working with .ifc files.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Foundation_Classes):
> The **Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)** data model is intended to describe architectural, building and construction industry data.

IFC format provides interoperability. This way, it doesn't matter what 
software you work on or what file format you deal with on a daily basis. 
There is a high probability that your software has import and export 
functions for .ifc files. Learn more about IFC format 
[here](https://www.buildingsmart.org/standards/bsi-standards/industry-foundation-classes/).

At this point, the project is in development. If you have any ideas on how it 
can be improved check [Contributions](https://github.com/tbrus/pyifc#contributions).
